-- Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed interest example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.
-- After removing these interests - how many unique interests are there for each month?
		
        -- Segment Analysis
-- Using our filtered dataset by removing the interests with less than 6 months worth of data, which are the top 10 and bottom 10 interests which have the largest composition values in any month_year? Only use the maximum composition value for each interest but you must keep the corresponding month_year
-- Which 5 interests had the lowest average ranking value?
-- Which 5 interests had the largest standard deviation in their percentile_ranking value?
-- For the 5 interests found in the previous question - what was minimum and maximum percentile_ranking values for each interest and its corresponding year_month value? Can you describe what is happening for these 5 interests?
-- How would you describe our customers in this segment based off their composition and ranking values? What sort of products or services should we show to these customers and what should we avoid?
		
        -- Index Analysis
-- The index_value is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average composition for Fresh Segmentsâ€™ clients.
-- Average composition can be calculated by dividing the composition column by the index_value column rounded to 2 decimal places.
-- What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?
-- For all of these top 10 interests - which interest appears the most often?
-- What is the average of the average composition for the top 10 interests for each month?
-- What is the 3 month rolling average of the max average composition value from September 2018 to August 2019 and include the previous top ranking interests in the same output shown below.
-- Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?
